### Introduction

#### About the Paper

*The Phillipian* is Phillips Academy's weekly, completely uncensored, and entirely student-run school newspaper. *The Phillipian* was first printed on July 28, 1857, making it the oldest preparatory newspaper in the country.

#### The State of the Academy

Every year around May, *The Phillipian* sends out a school-wide survey, dubbed the “State of the Academy” (SOTA). The survey, which is completely anonymous, asks questions about topics ranging from sexual activity, to drugs and alcohol usage, to political beliefs.

After releasing this year’s SOTA, we received requests from multiple schools asking for a copy of the questions that we included in our survey.

As part of our ongoing efforts to support and open source high-school journalism, we have decided to open source the questions used in the 2016 SOTA.

If you *do* plan on using our questions verbatim, or are inspired by them to write your own, we only ask that you let us know, so that we may add you to our list of participating schools. These questions are released under the [MIT license](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license), but we would appreciate being cited in any form of distribution.

### Distributing the Survey

In order to distribute SOTA, we use [Survey Monkey](http://surveymonkey.com), a survey creation and distribution tool. The Andover student body is about 1,150 students, so we paid for Survey Monkey's Gold Tier, needing to account for the possibility of an 100% respondent rate.

We recommend compiling a list of all of the students at your high school, in order to send individual emails. In our experience, the response rate will be higher, and there is no way to corrupt the data via multiple responses from one individual. **These results are still completely anonymous.**

You may also wish to offer various rewards for a high completion rate. For our survey, we offered to hold a school-wide raffle of Chipotle gift cards and a free photoshoot from one of our Photography Editors, if 90 percent of the school responded.

Below is a copy of the message that accompanied the survey link:

> **Subject: State of the Academy 2016**

> **Message:**
>
> Good afternoon,
>
> *The Phillipian* conducts an annual survey of the student body to gain a better understanding of life at Andover. Results are published in an issue called "State of the Academy.”
>
> The entire survey takes less than than ten minutes to finish. The results are completely anonymous, and responses cannot be tracked.
>
> Last year, 75 percent of students participated in “State of the Academy,” which is not an accurate representation of the student body. If 90 percent of students participate this year, we will host a school-wide raffle after the survey closes. The first prize will be a 20-dollar Chipotle gift card and a free photoshoot by Ryan McStudent ’17, and the second prize will be a ten-dollar Chipotle gift card. So, spread the word!
>
> The survey will close on Wednesday, April 27, at 12:00 p.m. Thank you in advance for your participation.

### 2016 Survey

This year's SOTA was broken up into seven different sections, and contained 80 questions in total. The list below links to a section-by-section breakdown of our questions. All questions were required.

- [General](/questions/general.md)
- [Wellness](/questions/wellness.md)
- [Sex](/questions/sex.md)
- [Drugs & Alcohol](/questions/drugs-and-alcohol.md)
- [School](/questions/school.md)
- [Identity](/questions/identity.md)
- [Discipline](/questions/discipline.md)

### Quantifying Race and Ethnicity

In past years, “State of the Academy” included the question: “What is your race/ethnicity?” This year, *The Phillipian* divided this question into two questions, one that asked about race and the other about ethnicity. Respondents were allowed to select more than one option for each of these questions to allow students who identify as more than one race or ethnicity to answer accordingly.

Unfortunately, Survey Monkey collected these responses in such a way that the answers were unable to be analyzed or crossed with information from other survey questions. The data seen in our issue was calculated by hand. Data about ethnicity was not collected.

### Publishing the Results

This year, *The Phillipian* published results from SOTA in [both print](http://archives.phillipian.net) and [online editions](http://sota.phillipian.net). The website, like these questions, is also [100% open source on GitHub](https://github.com/phillipian/sota).

### Andover Terminology

As part of the SOTA, we ask some questions that are closer to home. Below is a list of vocabulary that may be unique to the Phillips Academy campus.

- **Illegal Parietal (IP)**: When students of opposite sexes are in dormitory room together without permission from a House Counselor (dorm parent).
- **Disciplinary Committee (DC):** Body that convenes to determine the consequences of rule infractions.
- **Major Offenses:** "Certain offenses for which a student should expect to be dismissed from Phillips Academy regardless of any prior disciplinary record." —Phillips Academy's rule book.
- **Cruising:** Being out of a dormitory after sign in, without permission from a House Counselor or Dean.
- **6.0 Grading Scale:** Phillips Academy uses a 0-6 grading scale, as opposed to the traditional 0-4 grading scale used by most other high schools.

### Participating Schools
